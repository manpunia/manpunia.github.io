##### 6th October 2020,
it is already 6th october, Even can't remember what I am doing from 1-6th. 

Tech: 
Today completed Docker Essential course on IBM's cognitive classes.

Started reading book: Don't make me think : guide for web usability. Looks interesting.

###### Why consistency is so tough on any thing. I guess from tommorow onwards, leaving all the books aside and I will finish Atomic Habits by James clear.
