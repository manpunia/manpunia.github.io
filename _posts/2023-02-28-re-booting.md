it is been long time to sit in peace and write few words nobody will read. still at time of writing your mind gains a bit calmness. it slows down to a think about words to write. Missed this.

i am sure not this post is about what, may be i got some time or i wanted to distract myself. 

I am thinking of writing few words everyday for next 100 days, is it too much to think. or it is very ambitious goal. 

what it will be about? Tech, life or books?
