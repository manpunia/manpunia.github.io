If we don't find anything as we wish, we complain. how it should be or how bad it is. it create distroys harmony of life with that particular subject or thing. And in general no one is happy by complaining, other than it is bonding and small talk topic in most cases. or makes us feel smarter that we are so intellegent that we find this short comming in it.

as per above narrative complaining sounds like bad thing, in fact i reaslised i complaining is not right word. i meant in general negativity, pessimism.

so should we avoid it, as much as possible. but again question comes, if you don't find any shortcomings then how you are going to improve or grow. that is something to think about. for sure we need balance in both like find area of improvement with out switching to complaining mode and losing peace of mind.

But observe how in general we start complaining, is it possible to avoid complaing for next 2 weeks? are you ready for this challange, I am. let me update about it on 15th March 2023. How it went.
