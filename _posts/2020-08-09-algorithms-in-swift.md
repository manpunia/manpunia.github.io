# Algorithm practice in swift

I started learing swift. I know its late, still batter than never ðŸ¤ª. Practicing algorithm is not a bad way to learn any language. Where you find out hidden complexity of library function. Where you struggle and identify correct data structure for the problem, to beat time constraint set by coding platform. Best thing was swift is supported by leetcode.com.

I started solving problems few days back. I thought of documenting this journey, so I can look back and connect the dots. 
I will mentioning one algorithm questions and solution of that problem, and my struggle to solution. Swift data structure and API discussion for same problem.

So today's problems is from leetcode 76. Minimum Window Substring:
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Here is my initial approach
