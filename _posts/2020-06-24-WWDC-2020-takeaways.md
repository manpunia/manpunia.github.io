# Here are notes from video watched from WWDC-2020

We work on iPad and iOS app. So notes will taken to keep in mind what all the things can be used in our app batter. MacOS, catalyst and universal app things will be ignored


## 1. Platforms state of union

This session is just overview of technologies introduced this year for different platforms.
Following are things to looks for in detailed sessions.
1. New Widgets, since widget will be on main screen. Can relook to provide more usefull info in widgets.
2. Collection View
3. iPad Side View
4. Picker Related changes. (Need to visit whole UIKit for finding useful changes.
5. Swift on server side with vapor framework.
6. Lot of buzz around swiftUI.

Things didn't go as planned. But there are few points which not mentioned any where in WWDC or API change documents.

Apple had a way to add what kind of document are supported by your application. Add that info into info.plist and your app will appear as 'Copy to app' option for your application. Apple already stopped providing this options in few native apps from iOS 13, In iOS 14 this 'Copy to app' option is not available for any app. Most surprising thing is this is not documented or mentioned in any session.
