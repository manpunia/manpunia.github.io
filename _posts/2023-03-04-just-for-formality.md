when i started this challenge, for writing the posts every day, not thought much about the the topics for these posts. after posting these 3 days i think i need to change the direction or quality of these post usually i am just putting my raw thoughts at EOD without any kind of filter and this works for me as just a diary. 

may be instead of using these post as diary or me being a late night self-claimed philosopher. i change the topic of post and start posting some tech stuff.
