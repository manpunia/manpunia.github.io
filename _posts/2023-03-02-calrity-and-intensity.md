staring about yesterday's challenge about no complains. it is very hard, verbally i might have not complained but i caught my mind complaining a lot of time. but that challenge reminded to calm down and stop complaining. certainly learned behavior in long time, can't be undone in a day. 


why deciding the title of today's post, when i wrote `clarity and intensity`, i was reading it like insanity. if we think a bit deep it makes sense, more or less it is same thing. once you get the clarity, you become insane to acheive that target. just after writing this line, i relized that i am just writing this line to sound intelligent. myself never done that, that makes me wonder: i never gained clarity or what i just wrote is just cheesy line?
you might sense one more challenge coming up in these lines. in this way every post will generate a challenge, certainly this is good challenge to gain clarity and deep dive into. may be when i am revisit this after sometime at that time i evaluvate how much clarity i have gained. i will use this as gentle reminder for yourself.
