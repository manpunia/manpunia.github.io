⭐️

this books looks like, you have some story which are funny in you head but homour and funny side is lost while telling and explaing the story. humour is lost or it was not there at all. not funny for me atleast, again humour and fun is subjective to individaul.

PS: free books was not good idea. and abondone such books in half way, no shame in that. was not worth reading.
