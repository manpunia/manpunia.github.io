## Why I Read this book:
I wanted to get more grip on swift concepts, which are are new to me. like higher order function or protocols. I already went through documentation, was looking something more than documentation. 

## Review:
This book is absolutely delight to read, after a long time I enjoyed reading some technical book. Author not only explains concepts very well, great thing is it show diffrent concept can be used with one another and in which kind of situations. It covers tricks very well, that might be missed if you are reading the swift langauge guide. I would say this is must read for you if work with swift language, this is add-on book once you read swift language's manual. I wish this book is updated with latest swift version.
