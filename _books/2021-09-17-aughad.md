⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

this is quite a page turner book, other than premchand's book this is the book where i found author capture village life reality very vividly. i can't believe i didn't find this book earlier.

it shows all kind of equations from from village, the good, bad and ugly. the struggle of everyday life from diffrent sections of people and emotions of all kinds. this book rarely looks like a fiction, this capture reality. it have unexpected ending.
