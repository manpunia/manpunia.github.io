Rating: ✰✰✰✰✰(5/5)

Morgan's writing is very interesting. His attention to detail is very planned. You will clearly be able to notice how the background is prepared before delivering the message.

Each chapter in The Same as Ever delivers one key thing, like basic human behaviors, that never changes. And how those all thing impacts our day-to-day life. It gives you things to think about, and you will be able to connect with lots of scenarios in your life.

This deserves re-read and times to think.
