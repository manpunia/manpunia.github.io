reviewing book after a long time, from last sometime books were being read in smaller parts here and there. until i used to finish the book, used to get forget the starting. and not felt like writing down the review. 

Why I started this book:
naval is intersting person, which is being idealize for some and critisized by some. after reading and listening naval he appeared a guy who makes you think, instead of being guru and say this is the truth.

Take-away:

1. make health your P0.
2. find peace by trying the things.
3. read as much as possible.
4. life is futile and beautiful at sametime.
5. lot of things which will make you think in right direction.
